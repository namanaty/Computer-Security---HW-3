
To execute the program, follow the below steps:

1. Download the entire repository from github link (https://github.com/namanaty/Computer-Security---HW-3) into a folder or download files named "Namana_HW3.py" and "tinydb.json" into the same folder on your system.
2. Open the code file "Namana_HW3.py" in your integrated terminal or command line.
3. To install the cryptography library, run the command >> pip install cryptography
4. To install the tinydb library, run the command >> pip install tinydb
5. Run the program using the command >> python3 namana_hw3.py
6. Choose option 1 to encrypt a secret or option 2 to decrypt a secret. 
Note: You have to follow step 5 and 6 everytime you want to encrypt or decrypt the secret message
7. If you choose option 1 for encryption, input the plaintext and the password to store the secret securely. The output will be a ciphertext, which you should store for retrieval of the plaintext in the future.
4. If you choose option 2 for decryption, input the ciphertext and the password used during encryption. The output will be your original secret.
